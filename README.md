### These are my submissions to the data analyst nano-degree program by Udacity

The submission folders contains:

1.  Project 1 - Explore Weather Trends
> Where In this project, I will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where
I live to overall global temperature trends.

2.  Project 2 - Investigating Dataset
> Where I learn the data analysis process of questioning, wrangling, exploring, analyzing, and communicating data.
I Learn how to work with data in Python using libraries like NumPy and Pandas.
> For this project I chose the European Soccer Database, perform an investigation, and share my findings

3.  Project 3 - Analyze A/B Test Results

Showcase my wrangling efforts through analyses and visualizations.

5.  Project 5 - Communicate Data Findings
> Learn to apply sound design and data visualization principles to the data analysis process. Learn how to use
analysis and visualizations to tell a story with data.
> For this project I chose Prosper Loan Data, where I perform an exploratory data analysis
using Python. Then, create a presentation with explanatory plots that conveys my findings.
