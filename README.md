# [Data Analyst NanoDegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002)
Udacity - Data Analyst - Data Analysis with Python and SQL 

### These are my submissions to the data analyst nano-degree program by Udacity

The submission folders contain:

1.  [Project 1 - Explore Weather Trends](https://github.com/AmerJadid/Data_Analyst_NanoDegree/blob/master/Project_1_Exploring_Weather_Trends/Explore%20Weather%20Trends.ipynb)
> Where In this project, I will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where
I live to overall global temperature trends.

2.  [Project 2 - Investigating Dataset](https://github.com/AmerJadid/Data_Analyst_NanoDegree/blob/master/Project_2_Investigating_Dataset/European%20Soccer%20Database.ipynb)
> Where I learn the data analysis process of questioning, wrangling, exploring, analyzing, and communicating data.
I Learn how to work with data in Python using libraries like NumPy and Pandas.
> For this project I chose the European Soccer Database, perform an investigation, and share my findings

3.  [Project 3 - Analyze A/B Test Results](https://github.com/AmerJadid/Data_Analyst_NanoDegree/blob/master/Project_3_Analyze_AB_Test_Results/Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook.ipynb)
> I will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. My goal is to
work through to help the company understand if they should implement the new page design.

4.  [Project 4 - Wrangle & Analyze Data](https://github.com/AmerJadid/Data_Analyst_NanoDegree/blob/master/Project_4_Wrangle_%26_Analyze_Data/wrangle_act.ipynb)
> Learn how to apply inferential statistics and probability to important, real-world scenarios, such as analyzing
A/B tests and building supervised learning models.
> Gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it.
Showcase my [wrangling efforts](https://github.com/AmerJadid/Data_Analyst_NanoDegree/blob/master/Project_4_Wrangle_%26_Analyze_Data/wrangle_report.ipynb) through [analyses and visualizations]((https://github.com/AmerJadid/Data_Analyst_NanoDegree/blob/master/Project_4_Wrangle_%26_Analyze_Data/act_report.ipynb)).

5.  [Project 5 - Communicate Data Findings](https://github.com/AmerJadid/Data_Analyst_NanoDegree/blob/master/Project_5_Communicate_Data_Findings/exploration_loan_data_from_prosper.ipynb)
> Learn to apply sound design and data visualization principles to the data analysis process. Learn how to use
analysis and visualizations to tell a story with data.
> For this project I chose Prosper Loan Data, where I perform an exploratory data analysis
using Python. Then, create a [presentation with explanatory plots](https://github.com/AmerJadid/Data_Analyst_NanoDegree/blob/master/Project_5_Communicate_Data_Findings/slide_deck_loan_data_from_prosper.ipynb) that conveys my findings.
